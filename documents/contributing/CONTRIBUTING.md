## Important Resources

The important documents and links are on the [front page of the wiki.](../index.md)

## Improving Documentation

If you have a suggestion for the documentation, we ask that you take
a stab at making the changes to the documentation.  Simple changes can often be
made without a sophisticated pull release.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the
pull-request to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or
formatting issues.


### Whitespace Cleanup

Don't mix code or documentation changes with whitespace cleanup! If you are
fixing whitespace, include those changes separately from your code changes. If
your request is unreadable due to whitespace changes, it will be rejected.

> Please submit whitespace cleanups in a separate pull request.

## Reorganizing Filesystem / directory tree

Don't mix rearranging the location and names of files with code or documentation
changes! If you are rearranging the file system, please include those changes
separately from your code changes. 

> Please submit file system changes in a separate pull request.
